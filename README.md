<h1>Grocery Store App</h1>
link to github repo: https://github.com/veth91/grocerystore

<h2>What is this?</h2>
This is a "console" application that takes user inputs via the browser's prompt window and displays information in the javascript terminal. 


<h2>How to use the grocery store app</h2>

visit: https://veth91.github.io/grocerystore/
<br>
or
<br>
Open the index.html file in your browser. You will see a list of available commands. Be sure to open your javascript console before starting the app. To start the app, click the "Start App" button. Ensure that popup blockers are disabled as they can interfere with the prompts. 


<h2>Why I chose what I did</h2>
I really wanted to make this a full app with a beautiful front end full of buttons and slick animations. But the directions for the exercise clearly state "create a console or terminal application".
<br>
Initally I was excited to make a Node.js terminal application but that would require the end-user to install the app and set up thier environment properly. Additionally, it would have taken me considerably longer to complete. 
<br>
So I settled on the format of using prompts to collect user input and displaying information in the console. 
<br>

I tryed to demonstrate a few of my strengths in this app including: 
<ul>
	<li>
		Knowledge of modern JS
		<ul>
			<li>Arrow functions</li>
			<li>Obect Classes</li>
			<li>Template strings</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Modular design</li>
	<li>Data Validation (admittedly it could be a lot better, but I had to draw the line somewhere)</li>
	<li>
		Ability to follow instructions
		<ul>
			<li>
				The assignment clearly states the app needs to be a console app and the intro to the exrecise also states that "orchestrating the balance between people, process and technology" is important. I tried to make this app as easy to use and set up while still meeting the requirements of the exercise. 
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
	
<h2>What I would add</h2>
<ul>
	<li>A GUI!</li>
	<li>Better data validation </li>
	<li>Ability to edit entries</li>
</ul>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Can timeout if you change to another tab while prompt is open</li>
	<li>Data validation is weak</li>
	<li>Requires Console to be opened before starting app</li>
</ul>
